This is the code repository for the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12098.pdf. The dataset can be obtained from Experiment 1 in https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/paper-data/blob/master/Lineage_tracing_on_transcriptional_landscapes_links_state_to_fate_during_differentiation/README.md. 

Here is a description of each of the files: 

1. `GAN.py` --> GAN model code 
2. `cGAN.py` --> Conditional GAN model code
3. `data_preprocess.py` --> Code for setting up the data loaders in the unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised settings. 
4. `utils.py` --> Code for parsing arguments / data loaders
5. `main_conditional.py` --> Code for training and evaluating the conditional GAN in the unsupervised setting. 
6. `main.py` --> Code for training and evaluating the GAN in the semi-supervised setting. 
7. `main_supervised.py` --> Code for training and evaluating the GAN in the supervised setting. 

To run, first save the necessary data loaders by running `data_preprocess.py` (being sure to download all the data and have it saved first). Then, start a new visdom server (by running `python -m visdom.server -port 3000` in terminal), then run either `main_conditional.py`, `main.py` or `main_supervised.py` (in a new terminal tab).
